# # üêç Python OOP: Polymorphism with Classes

## üéØ AIM

To create two specific classes ‚Äî `Beans` and `Mango`. Then, create a **generic function** that can accept any object and determine its **type** (Fruit or Vegetable) and **color**, using polymorphism.

---

## üß† ALGORITHM

1. **Create Class `Beans`**:
   - Define `type()` method that prints `"Vegetable"`.
   - Define `color()` method that prints `"Green"`.

2. **Create Class `Mango`**:
   - Define `type()` method that prints `"Fruit"`.
   - Define `color()` method that prints `"Yellow"`.

3. **Define Generic Function `func(obj)`**:
   - Call `obj.type()` and `obj.color()` ‚Äî this works with both `Beans` and `Mango` objects, showcasing **polymorphism**.

4. **Create Objects**:
   - Instantiate `Beans` and `Mango`.
   - Pass them to `func()` and execute the program.

## üíª Program
```
class Beans(): 
     def type(self): 
       print("Vegetable") 
     def color(self):
       print("Green") 
class Mango(): 
     def type(self): 
       print("Fruit") 
     def color(self): 
       print("Yellow")
obj_beans = Beans() 
obj_mango = Mango()
for func in (obj_beans,obj_mango): 
    func.type()
    func.color()
```
## Output

## Result
The program was executed successfully. It correctly demonstrates polymorphism by defining two classes, Beans and Mango, each with methods to return their type (Fruit or Vegetable) and color. A generic function is used to accept any object and call the appropriate methods based on the object‚Äôs class.
